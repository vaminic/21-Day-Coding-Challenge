/*
Our latest testing indicates a malfunctioning 
component in our communications apparatus. For 
some reason, messages from mission control are not 
being correctly displayed on board the shuttle. While 
the message is being displayed on the shuttleâ€™s 
terminal, the senderâ€™s name is not displayed beside it.

Your first task is to write a function that will take two 
string parameters and return a string containing the 
sender name and the message in the form specified in 
the instructions.

/*
Example:
  Input:
    parseMessage("Mission Control", "Hello there!")
  Output:
     Mission Control: Hello there!
*/
const parseMessage = (origin, message) => {
  var out = origin + ": " + message;
  return out;
}
