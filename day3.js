//Solution:
const checkGaugeStatus = (gauge) => {

  if (gauge.current >= gauge.min && gauge.current <= gauge.max) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
  
}

/*
INSTRUCTIONS
Making sure that a value is within a specific range is 
a common task in programming. In this case, the 
structure given is a gauge object with a current 
value, a minimum and a maximum. If the current 
value is between the minimum and maximum, then 
everything is peachy, if not, we return a message 
saying that there is trouble.

Your task is to create a function that will take the 
gauge object as a parameter, and will return true if 
the current value is between the minimum and 
maximum, and return false if the value is outside 
those.

EXAMPLES
Input:
  const exampleGauge = {
    current:0.4,
    min:0.1,
    max:0.9
  }
Output:
  true
